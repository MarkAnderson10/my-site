# my-site
Starting on a simple design, I decided to grab some ideas off the web
and use some features from bootstrap that i've never used before.
Jumbotron being one that makes the site look clean if you have the right image.
From the original design, I switched up a few things once I started to use bootstrap components.
I decided to create a custom logo since it was my personal site, as well as adding a self portrait.
Although the style is a little plain on a couple of the pages (and repetitive), I like how
it transitioned from my original design into a working site.
